## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
    read_xlsx(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
        range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
    mutate(
        sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
        sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
    )
```

Read precipitation data\! For 2018 and 2017.

``` r
precip_2018 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
    relocate(year)
precip_2017 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
    relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation dataframes. In the following code
chunk, I create a “helper” tibble that contains pairs of numeric and
character ways of representing month, and then merge that (using month
number as a key) with the precipitation dataset. This technique is one I
use often when I need to recode a moderate or large number of values for
a variable.

``` r
month_df = 
    tibble(
        month = 1:12,
        month_name = month.name
    )
precip_df = 
    bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)
precip_df =
    left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, include some
specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final
dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation data. In
this dataset:

  - The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8
  - The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

## Problem 2

### read in the NYC transit data

``` r
nyc_transit_df = read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", 
                          col_types = "cccddccccccccccccccccclclcccddcc") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:vending, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = T, "NO" = F)) %>% 
  mutate(vending = recode(vending, "YES" = T, "NO" = F))
```

``` r
nyc_transit_df %>% 
  distinct(station_name, line, .keep_all = T) %>% 
  nrow()
## [1] 465
```

``` r
filter(nyc_transit_df, ada == TRUE) %>% 
  nrow()
## [1] 468
```

``` r
filter(nyc_transit_df, vending == F) %>%
  filter(entry == T) %>% 
  nrow()
## [1] 69
```

Reformat the route number and route name

``` r
nyc_transit_tidy = pivot_longer(nyc_transit_df, route1:route11,
             names_to = "route_name",
             values_to = "route_number",
             names_prefix = "route")
```

  - There are 273 distinct stations serve the A train.  
  - There are 107 distinct stations that A train are ADA compliant.
