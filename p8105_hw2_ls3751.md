## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
    read_xlsx(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
        range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
    mutate(
        sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
        sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
    )
```

Read precipitation data\! For 2018 and 2017.

``` r
precip_2018 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
    relocate(year)
precip_2017 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
    relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation dataframes. In the following code
chunk, I create a “helper” tibble that contains pairs of numeric and
character ways of representing month, and then merge that (using month
number as a key) with the precipitation dataset. This technique is one I
use often when I need to recode a moderate or large number of values for
a variable.

``` r
month_df = 
    tibble(
        month = 1:12,
        month_name = month.name
    )
precip_df = 
    bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)
precip_df =
    left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, include some
specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final
dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation data. In
this dataset:

  - The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8
  - The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

## Problem 2

### 2.1 Dataset overview

``` r
nyc_transit_df = read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", 
                          col_types = "cccddccccccccccccccccclclcccddcc") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = T, "NO" = F)) %>% 
  mutate(vending = recode(vending, "YES" = T, "NO" = F))
```

This dataset contains information about NYC subway MTA, including the
location, the lines each station served, infrastructure status and so
on. The 19 variables are line, station\_name, station\_latitude,
station\_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6,
route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entrance\_type, entry,
vending, ada.

The data cleaning process are as follow:

  - read in the dataset and clean the variable names so that they all
    display as snake case.
  - use select to pull variables of interest, and use mutate (recode) to
    covert character variables to logical variables.

The dimension of the dataset is 1868 rows \* 19 columns.

THe dataset is not tidy yet. Routine number and routine name seems to be
clustered together that rows did not represent the observations, and
columns are not variables.

### 2.2 Distinct stations and ADA compliant

``` r
nyc_distinct = nyc_transit_df %>% 
  distinct(station_name, line, .keep_all = T)

distinct_ada = filter(nyc_distinct, ada == TRUE)

no_vending_entry = filter(nyc_transit_df, vending == F) %>%
                  filter(entry == T)
no_vending = filter(nyc_transit_df, vending == F)
```

  - The number of the **distinct stations** is 465.
  - Among them, 84 stations are ADA compliant
  - Proportion of stations that have no vending allow entrance is
    0.3770492.

### 2.3 Distinct stations serve A & ADA

*Reformat the route number and route name*

``` r
nyc_transit_tidy = pivot_longer(nyc_distinct, route1:route11,
             names_to = "route_name",
             values_to = "route_number",
             names_prefix = "route")
```

  - There are 60 distinct stations serve the A train.  
  - There are 17 distinct stations that A train are ADA compliant.

## Problem 3

### 3.1 Data cleaning Step 1 (pol\_month):

  - *break up mon into year, month, and day*.
  - *replace month number with month name, create a president variable*.
  - *remove prez\_dem, prez\_gop, and day*.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
polmonth_df = read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, c("year", "month", "day")) %>% 
  mutate(president = case_when(
    prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop",
    prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem"),
         year = as.numeric(year),
         day = as.numeric(day),
         month = as.numeric(month))
polmonth_tidy = polmonth_df %>% 
  left_join(month_df, by = "month") %>% 
  mutate(month = month_name) %>% 
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day, -month_name)
```

### 3.2 Data cleaning Step 2 (snp):

  - *use a similar process*.
  - *make year and month leading columns*.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
snp_df = read_csv("./data/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, c("month", "day", "year")) %>% 
  mutate(month = as.numeric(month), 
          day = as.numeric(day), 
          year = as.numeric(year))
snp_tidy = snp_df %>% 
  left_join(month_df, by = "month") %>% 
  mutate(month = month_name) %>% 
  select(year, month, close)
```

### 3.3 Data cleaning Step 3 (unemployment):

``` r
unemployment_df = read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment") %>% 
  mutate(year = as.integer(year))
```

``` r
month_Lower = tibble(
  month = c("jan", "feb", "mar", "apr", "may", "jun", "jul", "aug", "sep", "oct", "nov", "dec"),
  month_name = month.name
)
```

``` r
unemployment_tidy = unemployment_df %>% 
  left_join(month_Lower, by = "month") %>% 
  mutate(month = month_name) %>% 
  select(year, month, unemployment)
```

*Join the three datasets accordingly*

``` r
analy_df = 
  left_join(polmonth_tidy,snp_tidy, by = c("year","month")) %>% 
  left_join(unemployment_tidy, by = c("year","month"))
```
